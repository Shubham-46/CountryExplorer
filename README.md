# CountryExplorer
The Country Details application allows users to explore information about various countries, including details such as demographics, geography, and more. Users can search for specific countries by name or region.

The technology stack for this application includes Vue.js, JavaScript, and Axios for handling HTTP requests.

I have also hosted the application on Netlify. You can check it out at https://country-details-explorer.netlify.app/

# Command to setup
npm install
npm run dev  # to start the application
npm i Axios  # in case it is not installed in your editor

# Application Preview
Note: We are using the free API available at https://restcountries.com/v3.1 for fetching country details. As it is a free public API, it might take some time to load the data or may not provide accurate data immediately. I have encountered this issue before.

Note: For some countries, the search results may not display the desired country at the top. For example, when searching for "China," it may not appear as the first result. Instead, the response from the backend may include all countries associated with the language or other criteria.
